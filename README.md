# Bootstrap-Portfolio

A portfolio of apps and websites that I have coded, for your viewing pleasure. Includes projects I have coded individually, as well as a travel information site which I contributed to along with Andrew Hanson, Aaron Gonzalez, Ivana Langerova and Reggie Battle.

Features an About Me page with a short bio and photo, a contact page with contact form, and portfolio page with links to all projects.
